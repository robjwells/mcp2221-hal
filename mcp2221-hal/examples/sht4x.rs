//! Use of the MCP2221 with embedded-hal to read from an SHT4x sensor over I2C.
//!
//! (If you've used I2C via embedded-hal before, skip this as it's very basic.)
//!
//! The [SHT40, SHT41, SHT43 and SHT45][sht] are temperature and humidity sensors made
//! by Sensirion that share an I2C interface. Here we demonstrate basic communication
//! with the sensor over I2C.
//!
//! You may wish to read this example alongside section 4 of the [SHT4x datasheet][sht].
