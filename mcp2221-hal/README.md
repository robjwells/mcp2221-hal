# mcp2221-hal

A driver for the [Microchip MCP2221][microchip] and MCP2221A USB to I2C, UART
and GPIO converter. It supports the [`embedded-hal`][] I2C and GPIO traits,
including [`embedded-hal-async`][].

A **CLI** to interact with the MCP2221, using this crate, is available as
[`mcp2221-cli`][].

## Feature flags

- `async` enables `embedded-hal-async` support.

## Features

All features of the MCP2221 are supported, except for "chip protection".

- I2C (with 7-bit addresses)
- GPIO
- ADC and DAC (analog input and output)
- Pin alternate modes (eg edge detection, clock output, etc)
- USB description configuration (eg PID, manufacturer name, etc)
- Initial configuration (in flash) and running configuration (in SRAM)

## Quick start

Here's a simple example showing I2C and GPIO usage:

```rust
// Creation with default USB VID & PID
let mut device = mcp2221_hal::MCP2221::connect()?;

// I2C
use embedded_hal::i2c::I2c;
let mut buf = [0u8; 2];
device.write_read(0x26, &[40, 2], &mut buf)?;
println!("{buf:?}");

// GPIO
use embedded_hal::digital::{InputPin, OutputPin};
use mcp2221_hal::gpio::{Input, Output, Pins};
let Pins { gp0, gp1, .. } = device.gpio_take_pins().expect("take once");
let mut gp0: Input = gp0.try_into()?;
let mut gp1: Output = gp1.try_into()?;
if gp0.is_high()? {
    gp1.set_low()?;
}
```

## UART (USB CDC serial)

This HAL does not contain UART-related functionality, because the MCP2221 exposes its
UART feature as a separate USB CDC serial port. You are better served using a separate
serial port library. See the crate documentation for more detailed advice.

## Quirks and unsupported features

This crate is **not thread safe** due to the underlying `hidapi` C library. The
`MCP2221` struct itself is `!Sync`, and `hidapi` _should_ prevent you from
connecting to a device that is already in use. However, sometimes you can
connect to the same device from another thread, only to crash later on. (Run
`cargo test` in the repo to see this in action!)

The **chip-protection** features (requiring a password for configuration
changes, or permanently locking the configuration) are not supported. If you
have an already-protected MCP2221 you will likely encounter an error.

**10-bit I2C addresses** are not natively supported by the MCP2221 and are not
_currently_ supported by the HAL (get in touch if you have a 10-bit target!).

The **I2C transaction** interface of `embedded-hal` does not support transactions where
a read precedes a write, with a repeated-Start in between. This is a limitation of the
MCP2221 USB HID interface (there's no way to perform a read without a Stop condition).

The **async** I2C interface blocks (it calls the `embedded-hal` trait methods).
There isn't async access to the USB HID device, so this is provided as a
convenience for developing `embedded-hal-async` drivers.

The extra functionality required for proper **SMBus** support is not provided by this
crate. The MCP2221 itself provides only standard I2C support, and you are better
served using a separate SMBus library on top of this crateâ€™s I2C features.

A number of **strange (buggy?) behaviours** of the MCP2221 have been identified
during development (particularly with the ADC and DAC). See the crate
documentation for details.

  Thank you to David Lattimore for writing this crate, it's what got me up and running
  with the MCP2221. David is now writing [wild][], a very fast linker.
